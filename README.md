# Farm DAO
## Abstract:
Blockchains play a vital role in FARMER to track and trace the origin of food products in food supply chain. Supply Chain Management (SCM) is an essential business process in all spheres of the economy. SCM uses speciﬁc processes to connect from producer to consumer requirement through a chain. In a BCT(Blockchain Technology) based system, “records are immutable and trusted, eliminating the need for third parties to be involved. Potential farmer-facing impacts include ensuring that farmers receive timely and complete payments through the use of smart contracts and helping farmers to capture real-time data to more effectively manage their crops and harvests. Another beneﬁt of using BCT in FARMER is security where hacking or tampering the existing data is impossible by any intermediary. Artificial Intelligence also plays a major in role in Suggestions, recommendation and removing sensitive contents of our web application. And also we create a platform for learn farming to increase FARMER productivity to our society. As some farmers may illiterate we integrate and support via whatsapp bot with Indian cultural.
<br/>
Building the farmers for the next generation. Its an DAO to help the farmers with the supplychain management, getting identity and apply for the loans.
<br/>
It is a multichain application it is currently live in polygon and flow blockchain network.

## Existing Apps:
1. 1 EDI Source.
2. Kinetic. 
3. Netstock.
4. NetSuite. Highly viewed <br/>
These are the few apps that only focus on the SCM but not to make familiar with farmer and industry.

## Our Feature:
Not only SCM is our only motto, but also building a Learning Platform to increase terrace farming or individual farming, Suggestion, recommendation and removing sensitive contents, Multilingual Support, Whatsapp Support, Funds Section. The State of Government of Tamil Nadu, Telegana, Karnataka and few more states are giving loans with lower interest only when farmers production limit is above 100kgs. We gonna make a proof of work of the production as soul nfts to avoid the scam generation. We are taking survey with the farmers to build our apps. Our goal to increase farmers productivity and human power to sustain them in economic. This would work for b2b marketing strategies. 
### Proposing Features:
-> Conventional techniques like Terrace Farming. <br/>
-> Check out the Farmers who received approvals. <br/>
-> we use NFt.storage to storing and retrieving images and videos from ipfs and filecoin. <br/>
-> Apply for funds easily. <br/>
-> A common place for buying and selling your agri products. <br/>
-> Minimize the Third Party. <br/>

## How will this solution be built & do you see it functioning in real time?
The solution for tracking and tracing food products in the food supply chain using Web3 technology will require the development of a decentralized application (dApp) that is built on a blockchain platform. This dApp will need to be designed to enable end-to-end traceability of food products, including information about their origin, processing, and distribution.
<br/>
To build this solution, the following steps would be required:

1. Define the use case and requirements: The first step would be to define the use case and requirements for the solution, including what information needs to be tracked and how it will be verified and recorded on the blockchain.

2. Choose a blockchain platform: Next, a blockchain platform would need to be selected, such as Ethereum or Hyperledger, that can support the required features and functionality of the dApp.

3. Develop the dApp: Once the blockchain platform is chosen, the dApp would need to be developed using Web3 technologies, such as Solidity or Web3.js. The dApp would need to be designed to enable the recording and verification of all relevant information about food products, including their origin, processing, and distribution.

4. Test and deploy the dApp: After the dApp is developed, it would need to be tested to ensure that it meets all of the requirements and functions as expected. Once testing is complete, the dApp can be deployed to the blockchain platform and made available for use by businesses and consumers.

5. Regarding the functionality of this solution in real-time, yes, it can function in real-time as the blockchain is designed to operate 24/7 without downtime. As soon as a new food product is added to the blockchain, it will be available for viewing and verification by all relevant parties in real-time. This can help improve the transparency and efficiency of the food supply chain while reducing the risk of fraud and errors.

## Why is web3 a great technology to solve this problem?
1. Web3 technology is a great fit for solving the problem of tracking and tracing food products in the food supply chain because it offers a secure and decentralized platform that can enable end-to-end transparency and traceability.

2. With Web3, all the records are immutable and trusted, eliminating the need for intermediaries such as third-party auditors, which can save time and costs for businesses. Additionally, Web3 technology enables the use of smart contracts, which can be used to automate the execution of agreements between parties and ensure timely and complete payments for farmers. This can help improve the transparency and efficiency of the supply chain while reducing the risk of fraud and errors.

3. Web3 technology also offers a high level of security, making it virtually impossible for hackers or other bad actors to tamper with the data in the system. This is especially important in the food supply chain, where transparency and security are critical to ensuring food safety and preventing fraud.

4. Artificial intelligence can also be integrated with Web3 technology to provide suggestions, recommendations, and other helpful insights to farmers, which can help them manage their crops and harvests more effectively.

5. Overall, Web3 technology can help revolutionize the food supply chain by enabling end-to-end traceability, improving efficiency and transparency, and enhancing the security of the system. This can ultimately benefit farmers, businesses, and consumers alike

## Tech Stack:
1. FrontEND: NextJS
2. BackEND:  Solidity, DynamoDB.
3. Framework: Tailwindcss, React-icons, MaterialUI, Biconomy, Filecoin, Hyperlane, 5irechain, CELO
4. Technologies: Blockchain, Cloud (AWS).
5. UseCases: We use Biconomy Social-Auth to connect web2 user to web3. As farmers has no idea regards wallet it will be the gateway to them. We use Push protocols to notify each step to step progress updation. And the Filecoin blockchain records transactions to provide verification of file storage
